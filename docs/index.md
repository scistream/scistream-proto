## About SciStream

SciStream is a security framework enabling high-speed data streaming between scientific instruments and high-performance computing (HPC) facilities. It securely allows participating facilities to make their resources available through a programmatic interface. The framework enables:

- End-to-end encrypted data transfer between instruments and HPC resources
- Zero-trust security model with strong authentication and authorization
- Flexible deployment options across institutions and environments
- Fine-grained access controls for scientific data
